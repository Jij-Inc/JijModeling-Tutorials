    "# Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is JijModeling?\n",
    "\n",
    "JijModeling is a Python package designed to intuitively write mathematical optimization models. Its main features are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allows writing models without specific instance data, leading to quicker verification of the model and easy reuse. Instance size does not affect the performance of writing and manipulating the model.\n",
    "- Works as a common interface for different kinds of optimization problems, including Linear Programming, Mixed Integer Programming, or Non-Linear Programming, and so on.\n",
    "- Models can be manipulated programmatically, allowing building up a model piece-by-piece and more complex logic in constraint construction.\n",
    "- Supports outputting to LaTeX. Mixed with Jupyter notebooks, this allows quick interactive feedback to check that your model fits what you expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "JijModeling is a tool for *writing* models using Python code, it does not evaluate or solve the models. The main motivation is to focus on the algebraic structure of the models, so that they can be reasoned about, verified and more nimbly altered regardless of the instance data, while still serving as a step towards generating the input formats the solvers expect. \n",
    "\n",
    "To be used with solvers, it needs to be paired with the actual instance data and converted into the specific solver’s input format by another tool, such as our internal [JijZept services](https://www.jijzept.com), or with the freely available [jijmodeling-transpiler](https://www.documentation.jijzept.com/docs/jijmodelingtranspiler/)."

    "\n",
    "To get a better idea of how to use jijmodeling, we’ll go over a basic example, starting with writing a simple model, converting it, then executing it with a solver. For the first two sections, jijmodeling is all you need, but we recommend using a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) to easily check LaTeX output.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the third section, we will be using [JijModelingTranspiler](https://www.documentation.jijzept.com/docs/jijmodelingtranspiler/) and [OpenJij](https://openjij.github.io/OpenJij/index.html). Note that jijmodeling models are also usable with our paid JijZept services. JijMdelingTranspiler and OpenJij can be installed as usual through `pip`:\n",

    "\n",
    "Working with JijModeling should feel natural to anyone familiar with mathematical optimization models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We represent various mathematical expressions by combining various classes, like `BinaryVar` and `Placeholder` using basic mathematical operations. `___Var` classes refer to different kinds of decision variables. `Placeholder` represents just about any kind of constant or value to be specified later. That is, they’re something we want to abstract away from the model and mark as part of instance-specific data. You can also use number literals, of course."
