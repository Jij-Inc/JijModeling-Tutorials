There are several types of optimization problems and corresponding problem-specific solvers which only accept their own specific data format, which in turn require incorporating data specific to a given problem instance. Using `jijmodeling`, you can write your optimization model in a single and mathematical way, then adapt it to solver and instance-specific details later."
