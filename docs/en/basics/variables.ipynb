    "JijModeling has two kinds of **variables**.\n",
    "One is the **decision variable**, a core component of mathematical optimization problems, whose value is determined by the solver.\n",
    "In addition, JijModeling has variables called **placeholders**, whose values are substituted with instance data at compile time.\n",

    "$N$ and $d$ are parameters whose values are assigned at compile time, i.e., **placeholders**, and are replaced by concrete values in an instance.\n",
    "On the other hand, each $x_i$ is a **decision variable** whose value is chosen by the solver, and they remain in the instance.\n",
    "In this example, the $x_n$ are indexed by the placeholder $N$, so their length is unknown at the modeling stage.\n",
    "At compile time, a concrete value of $N$ is fed, and in this example it expands to three independent decision variables.\n",

    "JijModeling provides a [`Graph` placeholder constructor](https://jij-inc-jijmodeling.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/autoapi/jijmodeling/index.html#jijmodeling.Problem.Graph) corresponding to directed graph structures.\n",
    "For example, `G = problem.Graph()` declares a placeholder graph with some number of vertices.\n",
    "This constructor is actually equivalent to a one-dimensional array of tuples described in \"[Single placeholders](#single_ph)\" and can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "G = problem.Placeholder(\n",
    "    dtype=typing.Tuple[jm.DataType.NATURAL, jm.DataType.NATURAL],\n",
    "    ndim=1\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, you can obtain the number of vertices via `N = G.len_at(0)` and use array operations to work with graphs.\n",
    "In this way, JijModeling lets you represent complex structures by combining tuples and arrays.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{danger}\n",
    "In JijModeling 1, a jagged array collection was available, where shapes are not uniform.\n",
    "However, due to its irregularity, jagged arrays are difficult to validate with type systems, so in JijModeling 2 they are **strongly discouraged** and planned to be removed in a future release.\n",
    "You can express graphs, non-zero-based indices, or sparse structures using combinations of arrays, tuples, and dictionaries, so we strongly recommend migrating away from jagged arrays.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionaries of variables and category labels\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to arrays, JijModeling lets you declare dictionaries (associative arrays) of variables.\n",
    "While arrays are useful for dense, zero-based indexing, dictionaries are useful for sparse or partially defined indices, or for indices that are not natural numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "JijModeling dictionaries come in two types based on constraints on their domains: `PartialDict` and `TotalDict`.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Dict type | Description |\n",
    "| :------- | :--- |\n",
    "| `PartialDict[K, V]` | A dictionary with keys of type `K` and values of type `V`. The key set may be any subset of `K`. |\n",
    "| `TotalDict[K, V]` | A dictionary that assigns a value of type `V` to **all possible values** of type `K`. Unlike `PartialDict`, it must be defined over the entire domain of `K`. |\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's look at the key types that can be used for dictionaries. There are only four basic kinds:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Integers (without decision variables)\n",
    "2. Strings\n",
    "3. Category labels\n",
    "4. Tuples whose components are any of (1) to (3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Among these, (3) **category labels** are unique to JijModeling: they are \"labels that can be used as dictionary keys, where the set of possible values is provided at compile time\".\n",
    "Each category label is treated as an atom that has no structure beyond equality (`==` / `!=`), and it becomes concrete only when you supply a set of strings or integers **as part of instance data at compile time**.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} Category labels vs placeholders\n",
    ":class: note\n",
    "\n",
    "Category labels are similar to placeholders in that they are provided as part of instance data, but strictly they are a different concept.\n",
    "This is because each category label adds a new kind of value that can be used as a placeholder, in a sense corresponding to a user-defined class or type in languages like Python.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} When to use category labels\n",
    ":class: hint\n",
    "\n",
    "Category labels are useful when:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The ordering of indices is not important\n",
    "2. You do not need numeric operations on indices\n",
    "3. You want human-readable names, such as strings\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `TotalDict` requires all possible values of type `K` to be enumerated, it can only be used for types with a bounded domain.\n",
    "Specifically, the allowed keys for each dictionary type are shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "| | Integers | Strings | Category labels | Tuples |\n",
    "| -----------: | :--: | :---: | :------------: | :---: |\n",
    "| `PartialDict` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Any tuple composed of the left types |\n",
    "| `TotalDict` | All naturals less than a decision-variable-free $n$ ($\\mathbb{N}_{<n}$) | A predefined list of unique strings | Yes | Any tuple composed of the left types |\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, \"Yes\" means anything that behaves as that type can be used as a key type.\n",
    "\n",
    "These conditions apply to dictionaries in general, not just dictionaries of variables.\n",
    "Below, we briefly introduce category labels and the declaration of dictionaries for decision variables and placeholders, then show concrete examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Declaring category labels\n",
    "\n",
    "Declaring category labels is similar to placeholders. You call [`CategoryLabel()`](https://jij-inc-jijmodeling.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/autoapi/jijmodeling/index.html#jijmodeling.Problem.CategoryLabel) on the model to register them.\n",
