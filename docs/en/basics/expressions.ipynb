    "## Types of expressions in JijModeling\n",
    "\n",
    "In JijModeling, expressions are classified by type and validated as needed.\n",
    "You can use JijModeling without understanding the type system in detail.\n",
    "Still, it is useful to know how the type checks are performed when you formulate models.\n",
    "This section gives a brief overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "JijModeling actually performs type checks in two stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Editor assistance and static checking via Python type hints\n",
    "2. A built-in type checker in JijModeling during model construction\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) is bundled as Python code in the library and enables editor completion and static checks with tools like `Pyright`, `ty`, and `pyrefly`.\n",
    "However, Python type hints cannot express all constraints (for example, validating array index sizes).\n",
    "To compensate, JijModeling includes (2), its own more expressive type checker.\n",
    "\n",
    "The checker in (2) is not invoked directly by users. It is called when you add constraints or objective terms, declare `shape` for decision variables/placeholders, and so on, and it validates modeling mistakes **before** any data is provided.\n",
    "In other words, editor checks are \"coarser\" than the true JijModeling type system, while finer checks happen during construction.\n",
    "At the Python type level, the only distinction is whether something is an {py:class}`Expression <jijmodeling.Expression>`, but JijModeling checks much more detail internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several expression types in JijModeling; representative ones are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Kind | Notation (example) | Textual example | Description |\n",
    "| :--- | :----------------- | :------------- | :--- |\n",
    "| Numeric types | $\\mathbb{N}, \\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbb{R}$ | `natural`, `int`, `float` | Natural numbers, integers, real-valued scalars, and related numeric types. |\n",
    "| Category label types | $L$ | `CategoryLabel(\"L\")` | Sets of labels provided later by users. |\n",
    "| Higher-dimensional array types | $\\mathrm{Array}[N_1 \\times \\cdots \\times N_k; \\mathbb{R}]$ | `Array[N1, .., Nk; float]` | Arrays with an element type and a shape. |\n",
    "| Dictionary types | $\\mathrm{TotalDict}[K; V]$ / $\\mathrm{PartialDict}[K; V]$ | `TotalDict[K; V]`, `PartialDict[K; V]` | Dictionaries with key type $K$ and value type $V$. |\n",
    "| Tuple types | $T \\times U$ | `Tuple[int, float]` | Fixed-length tuples with per-component types. |\n",
    "\n",
    "With these in mind, let's look at operations that commonly appear in modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} When errors are raised\n",
    ":class: important\n",
    "\n",
    "JijModeling's built-in type checking is performed **not right after an expression is created**, but at the following times:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When a term is added to a problem's objective\n",
    "2. When a constraint is declared via {py:meth}`Problem.Constraint() <jijmodeling.Problem.Constraint>`\n",
    "3. When it appears in `ndim`, `shape`, or `dict_keys`\n",
    "4. When compiling to an instance via {py:meth}`Problem.eval() <jijmodeling.Problem.eval>` or {py:class}`~jijmodeling.Compiler`\n",
    "5. When type inference is explicitly triggered via {py:meth}`Problem.infer() <jijmodeling.Problem.infer>`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because expression types are determined only when placed in context.\n",
    "So even if an expression is \"invalid\", it does not necessarily throw an error at construction time.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we use {py:meth}`Problem.infer() <jijmodeling.Problem.infer>` to show valid and invalid examples.\n",
    "This method infers the type of a given expression based on the decision variables and placeholders defined in the `Problem`, and it raises a type error for invalid expressions.\n",
    "Let's look at an example. Here, we add a binary variable $x$ and an integer $N$, so $x + N$ is inferred as an integer-type expression $\\mathbb{Z}$."

    "\n",
    "Like Python lists, dictionaries, or {py:class}`numpy.ndarray`, JijModeling expressions support multi-dimensional indexing such as `x[i, j]`.\n",
    "Specifically, you can index expressions of the following types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (Multidimensional) arrays\n",
    "   + **Allowed indices**: natural-number expressions that do not include decision variables\n",
    "2. Dictionaries\n",

    "3. Tuples\n",
    "   + **Allowed indices**: natural-number expressions (within the tuple length) that do not include decision variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Indices can only include natural numbers, integers, or category labels that do **not** include decision variables.\n",
    "You can write multiple indices at once, like `x[i, j, k]`. Using too many indices (more than the tuple length, array dimension, or dictionary tuple length) results in a type error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Array indexing also supports slicing syntax such as `x[:, 1]`.\n",
    "In this case, `x[:, 1]` keeps all elements along the 0th dimension and selects index `1` on the 1st dimension.\n",
    "If `x` is 2D, the result is a 1D array; if `x` has dimension $N \\ge 3$, the result is $(N-1)$-dimensional.\n",
    "If `x` is 1D or scalar, it is a type error.\n",
    "Slices with step and end indices, like `x[1, 1:N:2]`, are also supported.\n",
    "For details on slice syntax, see the Python docs on \"{external+python:ref}`slicings`\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting the index set of array/dictionary expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "For array and dictionary expressions, you can obtain their index sets.\n",
    "For arrays, use {py:meth}`~jijmodeling.Expression.indices`; for dictionaries, use {py:meth}`~jijmodeling.Expression.keys`.\n",
