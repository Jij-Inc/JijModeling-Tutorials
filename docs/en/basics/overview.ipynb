    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will go through the essential basics for working with mathematical optimization problems in JijModeling.\n",
    "We will also introduce the Plain API and the Decorator API side by side when it is helpful, as mentioned in the {doc}`../introduction` section.\n",
    "Before moving on, it helps to skim at least one of the quickstarts ({doc}`SCIP <../quickstart/scip>` or {doc}`OpenJij <../quickstart/openjij>` versions) to get a feel for the overall workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{seealso}\n",
    "For a general introduction to mathematical optimization, see other references such as JijZept's \"[Basics of Mathematical Optimization](https://www.jijzept.com/ja/docs/tutorials/optimization_basics/01-introduction/)\".\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "This section covers the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **{doc}`problem`**: In JijModeling, variables and constraints are always registered into a specific mathematical model. We start with how to declare a model.\n",
    "2. **{doc}`variables`**: We discuss decision variables and placeholders (parameters that are substituted with instance data), along with their families and how to declare them.\n",
    "3. **{doc}`expressions`**: How to build expressions in JijModeling, used for objectives, constraints, and variable shapes.\n",
    "4. **Mathematical model formulation** (coming soon): How to set objectives and constraints using the elements above.\n",
    "5. **Creating instances** (coming soon): How to provide instance data and generate instances, with a brief note on the configuration of constraint detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout  this document, \"natural numbers\" mean non-negative integers including $0$.\n",
    "We also use \"scalar\" to collectively refer to natural numbers, integers, and real numbers.\n",
    "A constant expression that represents a concrete numeric value without any variables, such as $1, 2, 3$ or $5.2$, is called a \"constant literal\"."
