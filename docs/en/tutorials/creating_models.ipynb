There are several types of optimization problems, and solvers specific to those problems only accept solver-specific data formats. Therefore, it is necessary to convert mathematical models into solver-specific data formats. By using `jijmodeling`, you can describe mathematical models in a single mathematical way and then adapt them to solver- or instance-specific details."
