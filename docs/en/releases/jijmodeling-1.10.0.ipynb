    "This enhancement provides hints to improve solver performance for compatible solvers. Detected constraints can be accessed via the `constraint_hints` property in `ommx.v1.Instance`."

    "\n",
    "Type hinting across submodules has been significantly improved to resolve Pyright errors that previously occurred. This improvement leverages advancements in `pyo3-stub-gen` ([see](https://github.com/Jij-Inc/pyo3-stub-gen/releases/tag/0.6.1)) to ensure seamless type checking in submodules.\n",

    "\n",
    "This release resolves a logic error in calculating the ndim (number of dimensions) for jagged arrays. The bug caused errors during Interpreter initialization and prevented evaluation of instances loaded through the MIPLIB loader."
