    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is JijModeling?\n",
    "\n",
    "**JijModeling** is a mathematical optimization modeler that lets you describe mathematical models in Python code.\n",
    "Using polynomials and other mathematical expressions, you can express many kinds of optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main features\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Separation of mathematical models and parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "JijModeling separates the symbolic definition of a mathematical model from input parameters (**instance data**).\n",
    "Instance data corresponds to coefficients and other inputs besides decision variables, and a mathematical model is **compiled** into solver input (an **instance**) only after instance data is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{figure} ./images/model-and-instance-illustrated.svg\n",
    ":alt: When instance data is supplied to a symbolic model, solver input data (an instance) is generated\n",
    ":width: 75%\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide parameters (**instance data**) to a mathematical model to obtain an instance\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, each model serves as a schema that produces instances from individual instance data, and you can modify the model *without* being affected by the size of the instance data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Solver-independent modeling\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{figure} ./images/jijmodeling-workflow.svg\n",
    ":alt: Models defined in JijModeling are passed to solvers via OMMX\n",
    ":width: 75%\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflow of solving optimization problems with JijModeling and OMMX\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical models defined in JijModeling are ultimately **compiled** into instances expressed in the [OMMX Message format](https://jij-inc.github.io/ommx/en/introduction.html).\n",
    "OMMX Message is a solver-independent data exchange format for mathematical optimization, so you can **switch solvers freely** among those provided by Jij (such as JijZeptSolver and OpenJij, etc.) and other solvers (such as SCIP, Gurobi, and FixstarsAmplify, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Early error detection with type checking\n",
    "\n",
    "JijModeling has its own type system to catch errors such as mismatched index dimensions while writing models.\n",
    "You can detect mistakes immediately, especially before inputting large instance data, which speeds up formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Automatic detection of constraint patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Some mathematical optimization solvers offer faster algorithms for specific constraint structures.\n",
    "Typically, users must explicitly identify and invoke these optimizations.\n",
    "JijModeling can **automatically detect** such constraints and pass the information to the solver through OMMX, speeding up solution without user intervention.\n",
    "In the example below, simply enabling detection yields dramatic speedups.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{figure} ./images/detection-speedup.svg\n",
    ":alt: Without detection, solve time grows quadratically or exponentially in input size; with constraint detection, the growth becomes much more gradual and linear\n",
    ":width: 100%\n",
    "\n",
    "Speedup from constraint detection in the two-region plant location problem\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. $\\LaTeX$ rendering of models\n",
    "\n",
    "JijModeling provides powerful $\\LaTeX$ output, allowing you to inspect model definitions intuitively in the [JijZept IDE](https://www.jijzept.com/en/products/ide/), [Google Colab](https://colab.google/), or standard [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) environments.\n",
    "With this, you can quickly and interactively confirm that your model is built as expected.\n",
    "Below is an example of a formulation of Knapsack Problem and its $\\LaTeX$ output."
